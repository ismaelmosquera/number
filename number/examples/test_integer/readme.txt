The example is already compiled, but you can rebuild it if you wish.
To rebuild the example, use one of the two scripts ( build.bat or build.sh ).
If you are under a linux like shell type:
./build.sh

If you are using a 'cmd' MS-Windows command line type:
build

To run the example use one of the two scripts ( run.bat or run.sh ).
If you are under a linux like shell type:
./run.sh

If you are using a 'cmd' MS-Windows command line type:
run

After running the example, an 'out.txt' file with the testing result will be created and placed in the 'bin' folder.
