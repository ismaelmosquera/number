The 'number-set.jar' file is already compiled, but you can rebuild it again if you wish.
To rebuild the library, use one of the two simple scripts ( build.bat or build.sh ).
If you are under a linux like shell type:
./build.sh

If you are using the 'cmd' MS-Windows command line type:
build

An the 'number-set.jar' file will be created and place into the 'lib' folder.
We hope that this work can be interesting and useful for someone.
