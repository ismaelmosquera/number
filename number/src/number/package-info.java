/**
* The package <code>number</code> was, mainly, developed for educational pourposes.
* <p>
* In this piece of software, you can find implementations for the five number sets:
* <ul>
* <li>Natural ( N )</li>
* <li>Integer ( Z )</li>
* <li>Rational ( Q )</li>
* <li>Real ( R )</li>
* <li>Complex ( C )</li>
* </ul>
* <p>
* where as already you should know:
* <p>
* N included in Z included in Q included in R included in C
* <p>
* So, the implemented operations, all of them implemented from the scratch, produce results that are also included in its own set,
* <p>
* or, if it is the case, in a subset of the concrete set.
* <p>
* Each set has its concrete supported operations. Special  attention to the 'R' set, since there are a lot of interesting mathematical functions
* <p>
* wich can be of interest in order to know how are they implemented.
* <p>
* Such a functions were coded, mainly, using Taylor and Maclaurin Series.
* <p>
* Other ones were implemented by combinations of them.
* <p>
* To code the <code>ComplexNumber</code> class, we use functions of the <code>RealNumber</code> class,
* <p>
* since a complex number is, actually, a pair of real numbers.
* <p>
* We hope that you appreciate and enjoy this work.
