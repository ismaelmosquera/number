  
#### **NUMBER SET**  
  
This software package written in the Java programming language has been developed, mainly,  
for educational purposes, not to put in production.  
That is because the implementation is not efficient at execution time.  
  
The idea was to demonstrate the existing number sets:  
>  
> - Natural ( N ).  
> - Integer ( Z ).  
> - Rational ( Q ).  
> - Real ( R ).  
> - Complex ( C ).  
>  
  
where N included in Z included in Q included in R included in C  
  
What is interesting in this work is that all the methods ( you also call them functions in this case ),  
are all coded from the scratch.  
Special attention to the RealNumber class where you can find how to implement functions such as:  
>  
> - Analitic functions ( exp, log, log2, log10, pow, sqrt, curt, ithrt ...  
> - Trigonometric functions and its inverses.  
> - Hyperbolic functions.  
> - Other general purpose funcions.  
>  
  
All of them were developed, mainly, using Taylor | Maclaurin Series, and combinations of them.  
All the number sets were coded to simulate each set, where the resulting value for any  
operation also belongs to the same set or maybe a subset of it.  
If you are interested in knowing how to develop these fundamental mathematic functions, you have found the place you were looking for.  
There is an API documentation and examples for every numerical set.  
We hope that you appreciate and enjoy this work.
